                                Dr. Pete Ibida, the representative for Njikoka Two Constituency in the Anambra State
                                House of Assembly, has assumed the position of the new Majority Leader of the House.
                                Other key officers elected by members of the All-Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA)
                                include Honourable Beverly Ikpeazu-Nkemdiche, representing Onitsha South Two
                                Constituency, as the Chief Whip, and Honourable Ifeanyi Chiekwu, representing Idemili
                                North Constituency, as the Deputy Chief Whip. These appointments were officially
                                announced by the Speaker of the House, Right Honourable Uche Okafor, during the plenary
                                session held yesterday. Dr. Ibida, speaking on behalf of the newly elected officials,
                                explained that their appointments were necessitated by the unfortunate passing of the
                                former Majority Leader, the late Dr. Nnamdi Okafor, who died in South Africa last year
                                while on official duty, leaving a vacancy in the leadership.

                    <p class="about-content">
                        A fifty-five-man campaign organization for Pete Ibida was inaugurated with a charge to actualize
                        the federal House of Representatives ambition of the lawmaker. The inauguration, held at the
                        country home of the lawmaker in Nimo, Njikoka Local Government Area of Anambra State, appointed
                        Mr. Patrick Onyedum as the Director General of the campaign organization.

                        Hon. Ibida, a two-time member of the Anambra State House of Assembly, recounted the numerous
                        projects he had undertaken in each ward in his constituency. He promised to double his
                        performance as a federal lawmaker during the 2023 general election. Describing himself as an
                        experienced facilitator and advocate of good governance, Honourable Ibida asserted that he is
                        not going to the National Assembly as a novice but as a lawmaker who knows how to exploit
                        opportunities to attract democracy dividends for his constituency.

                        In inaugurating the members of the campaign organization, the lawmaker characterized them as
                        high performers and a winning team committed to doing all that is necessary to achieve their
                        goals.

                <p class="about-content p-3">
                    Hon. Pete Ibida possesses a proven track record of excellence. After successfully completing the
                    National Youth ServiceCorps (NYSC) Program at Tabs Assurance Ltd (African Overseas Insurance Ltd),
                    Enugu, he was retained and achieved three promotions within a year. He ascended to the esteemed
                    position of Company Secretary and Personnel Manager before deciding to move on. <br><br>

                    <span>
                        As the CEO of Piekle International Ltd, Hon. Pete Ibida consistently demonstrated a high level
                        of professionalism and strategic focus in the Oil and Gas industry. This resulted in strong
                        partnerships with major industry players, including Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC)
                        and other key stakeholders. He led Piekle International Ltd. with unwavering dedication,
                        overseeing operations across various Oil Fields and Flow Stations.
                    </span> <br><br>

                    His legislative journey was equally impactful. He served as the Chief Whip of the Anambra State
                    House
                    of Assembly and was later elected as the Majority Leader during the 7th Assembly due to my
                    significant contributions. He remains deeply committed to core values, including integrity,
                    professionalism, diligence, and a strong sense of philanthropy
